SharpServer HTTD
(C) Cody Mays 2012

A simple threaded HTTP server I wrote while bored at school one day. Code is still messy as I have not cleaned it up at all yet.

TODO:
- Cleanup file handling on requests. Works now, but super repetitive and just not elegant at all.
- Insure proper thread shut down
- More error handling/logging
- CGI/PHP support module
- Python support module
- Clean out repo of files that I should not have initially imported
